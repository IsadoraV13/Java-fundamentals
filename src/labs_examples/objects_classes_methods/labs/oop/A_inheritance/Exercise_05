Without running the code below, please tell me what will print. Why?

ANSWER:
"Parent called"
"Child called"

Because the parent class needs to exist before the child class can exist and the creation of the parent leads to
"Parent called" being printed to the console


public class InheritanceTest
{
  public static void main(String[] args)
  {
    Parent c = new Child();
  }
}

class Parent
{
  public Parent()
  {
    System.err.println("Parent called");
  }
}

class Child extends Parent
{
  public Child()
  {
    System.err.println("Child called");
  }
}
